rally sons of notre dame
sing her glory and sound her fame
raise her gold and blue
and cheer with voices true
rah rah for notre dame
we will fight in every game
strong of heart and true to her name
we will ne'er forget her
and will cheer her ever
loyal to notre dame

cheer cheer for old notre dame
wake up the echoes cheering her name
send a volley cheer on high
shake down the thunder from the sky
what though the odds be great or small
old notre dame will win over all
while her loyal sons are marching
onward to victory
